# PC-IR-remote
Program that takes input from an infrared TV remote and translates it into Windows media functions through a connected Arduino and a Python script on the host machine.


This was specifically designed for use with an Arduino Uno along with an IR receiver to be used with a Sony BD RMT-VB200U IR remote. 
The Arduino takes input from the IR remote, then translates it into a message on a serial monitor. With the Arduino connected to a Windows PC through a USB cable and the Python program running, the Python code reads the messages coming through the serial monitor, and then activates a corresponding function 
on the Windows computer, whether it be changing the volume, playing/pausing media, moving the mouse cursor, etc. 

Included are two stl files for 3d printing a simple enclosure for an Arduino Uno and IR sensor, also created by me. 

This code was written in its entirety by me.
